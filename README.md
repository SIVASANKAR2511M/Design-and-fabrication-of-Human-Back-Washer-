# Design-and-fabrication-of-Human-Back-Washer-
It is difficult wash our posterior back by our self, by using only our hands we cannot wash  it easily. So we are making a machine which is attached to the toilet which do not need an  individual space for setup. A certain number of rollers are connected and being rotated by a motor  and it will start to rotate.
